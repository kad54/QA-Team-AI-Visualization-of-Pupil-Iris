# QA Team AI Visualization of pupils and irises

AI visualization of object detection needs to replace the very basic bounding-boxes or circles. Therefore, the QA Team was asked to find creative alternatives of such visualizations. The purpose of this task would be to list the methods or libraries names with the examples of the images of object visualizations, such as pupil, iris, face mesh and eye-tracking.
